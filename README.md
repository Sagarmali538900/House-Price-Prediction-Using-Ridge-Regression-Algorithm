# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Ridge-Regression-Algorithm
This notebook builds a Ridge Regression model to predict house prices using multiple numerical and categorical features.

## 🏡 What This Notebook Does

* Loads and preprocesses housing dataset
* Handles feature scaling and encoding
* Trains a Ridge Regression model
* Compares performance with baseline models
* Evaluates results using metrics like RMSE / R²

---

## 📁 Files

* `House_Prediction_Ridge.ipynb` — complete model workflow
* Housing dataset (CSV) — required

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook House_Prediction_Ridge.ipynb
```

Ensure the dataset is in the same folder or update the file path inside the notebook.
